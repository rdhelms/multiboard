# Multiboard

Multiboard allows users to publish public or private backgrounds and interactive boards for...anything!

* Quick instructions
  - Refresh public and private scenes and backgrounds.  
    - Backgrounds contain unobtrusive objects that do not interact with characters or objects
    - Scenes hold the objects and characters.  Characters are normally drawn small or just a plain circle.
  - Select a public or private background or scene or go straight to the Drawing Board to start creating!
  - Once in the drawing board...
    - Users can clean the canvas on the left button loadout
    - Light panel color designates which type of drawing you will be making.  
    - Again, select background for non-interactive color schemes, obstacles for objects the characters cannot move through, and chracter(s) for what the arrow keys will move around the screen.
    - Undo and redo buttons will delete and un-delete objects from the screen infinitely.
  - Publish saves will create public backgrounds and scense, where just saving will store to your local storage on your machine.  
  - Feel free to edit your backgrounds and scenes whenever you see fit!  Add to our database to share your creations!
